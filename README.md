## What's that
Simple project to track time throughout which a user's been doing something. 

The idea itself is very simple :)

The first iteration of the project looks like this:

## TODO
- [ ] Create basic themes & colors (heare are two colors: #33327b and #ff41c4)
- [ ] Create a shared preferences mechanism for saving values
- [ ] Build a layout that looks like the one on the screen above
- [ ] Implement the countdown timer
- [ ] Connect the shared preferences with the click & the countdown timer (last step)

## Future
There are loads of ideas on the app's functionality - for now it does just one thing.

Will describe some of the vision after all of the TODO's are done :white_check_mark:

## Contribution
If you'd like do help with the project (actually, I let you do all of the first feature described in TODO), just fork the repo, **create a feature branch** with understandable name and make a pull request! :tada:
